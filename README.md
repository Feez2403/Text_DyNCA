# Text to DyNCA

This code extends the work done in [[DyNCA](https://dynca.github.io/)] to create NCAs able to synthesize animated pictures from text.
The repo contains also a motion prediction neural network that predicts the vector flow target of the DyNCA.

To train the model, please use colab by clicking on the button below
